This is an open source farming game built with web technologies. Some basic ideas are implemented and stable, but currently this is far from being a "game." It's in a proof-of-concept state and will likely be there for some time. I am working on this entirely solo in my free time and am challenging myself to build it with strictly open development tools (aside from hardware and operating systems). I am designing this game such that it would be fun for anyone that is into resource management and farming games, but ultimately my goal to make the game that I wish existed. And I want to have fun doing it! ðŸ™‚

## Branch structure

- Active development takes place in `develop`.
- `master` is updated when `develop` is stable.
- `gh-pages` contains the built assets and is updated automatically when `master` is updated.

There is no release or versioning system yet.

## Current Progress

Progress was initially tracked via [`docs/milestones.md`](docs/milestones.md), but I've since switched to using [this Github project](https://github.com/jeremyckahn/farmhand/projects/1) for organzing tasks. If you'd like to suggest a feature or ask a question, please [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/jeremyckahn/farmhand/issues).

## Project overview

This project is built with [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/)), so please refer to the documentation of that project to learn the development toolchain.

## Versioned releases

npm makes it super easy to make versioned releases! This project is set up to run tests before making a release, which helps prevent you from releasing new versions with bugs. This happens automatically thanks to the [npm version scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version).

```
npm version patch # Or "minor," or "major"
```

This will also use the [gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages) utility to deploy your versioned project with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
